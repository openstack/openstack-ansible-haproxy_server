    Variables ``haproxy_fall`` and ``haproxy_rise`` are now respected again
    and will be used for defining amount of checks before haproxy will mark
    backend as UP or DOWN. Keys ``backend_rise`` and ``haproxy_fall`` that are
    set inside service definition are still respected and will have
    prescedence over global ones.
