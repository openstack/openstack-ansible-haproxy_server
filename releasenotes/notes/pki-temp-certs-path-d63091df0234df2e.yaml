    If directory is defined instead of certificate files, haproxy will attempt
    to treat all files within as a pem bundled certs. And will fail its
    configuration test.
    To avoid this a new variable haproxy_ssl_temp_path were introduced. When it
    is defined certificates from the pki being put into that directory and then
    combined into pem in the correct directory.

    Such an approach allows us to put additional certificates to the directory
    outside of the haproxy_server role and keep the directory clean. This also
    eliminates the need to list all additional custom certificates and sum them
    with the ones calculate by this role.

    Additionally added a cleanup/move of the certs if haproxy_ssl_temp_path set
    to be different from  haproxy_ssl_cert_path which allows a transition from
    old setup.
